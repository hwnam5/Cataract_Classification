# Cataract Classification - ViT

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a classification model to determine the presence and severity of cataracts in dogs. Cataracts are a significant cause of vision impairment in dogs, making early detection and accurate diagnosis crucial. The goal is to extend this model into a web or app service for quick detection without needing to visit a veterinarian. This project is part of a team machine learning project at Ajou University.

### Project Requirements, Assumptions, Risks, and Constraints

	• Requirements: Develop a highly accurate diagnostic model, with a particular focus on high recall for detecting early-stage cataracts (incipient).

	• Assumptions: The image data from AI-Hub is representative and accurately labeled.

	• Risks: The challenge of diagnosing cataracts using only image data, without additional medical equipment and tests.

	• Constraints: The model’s success criteria include achieving over 80% in accuracy, F1 score, and recall.

## Data

### Data Collection

	•	Source: AI-Hub canine eye images.
	•	Classes: No cataract, incipient, mature, overripe.
	•	Preprocessing: Resize images to 224x224 pixels, remove backgrounds, balance classes.

### Data Cleaning

	•	Removed black background images, minimized hair regions using grab cut algorithm, and applied blur to reduce remaining hair impact.

## Methodology

### Initial Models

	•	CNN, VGG16, ResNet50: Tested on initial pre-processed data, but all showed poor accuracy (0.51 - 0.67).

### Model Comparison

	1.	CNN-LSTM: Rejected due to low accuracy (0.46 - 0.41) on multi-class classification.
	2.	Pyramid-Net: Rejected due to poor performance (accuracy 0.58).
	3.	ViT: Accepted with the highest initial accuracy (0.79).
	4.	DeiT: Rejected due to implementation challenges and poor performance (accuracy 0.60).

### Hyperparameter Tuning

	•	Optimized using optuna, achieving best results with lr = 1e-4 and batch size = 16.

## Results

### Model Performance

	•	Accuracy: 0.849 with the final ViT model.
	•	Challenges: Distinguishing incipient from overripe cataracts.

### Conclusion

The final model effectively classifies cataracts in dogs with high accuracy. Future work will focus on further model tuning and expanding applications.
